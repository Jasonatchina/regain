regain is a search engine similar to web search engines like Google, with the difference that you don't search the web, but your own files and documents. Using regain you can search through large portions of data (several gigabytes!) in split seconds!

This is possible by using a search index. regain crawles through your files or webpages, extracts all text and puts it in a smart search index. All this happens in the background. So if you want to search something you get the results immediately.

There are two versions of regain: The desktop search and the server search. The desktop search is to be used on a normal desktop computer and it offers you a fast search for documents or intranet webpages. The server search you can install on web servers. It provides searching functionality for a website or for intranet fileservers.

regain is written in Java and thus applicable on all Java compatible platforms (amongst others Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Solaris). The server search works with Java Server Pages (JSPs) and a tag library, the desktop search comes with its own small webserver.

regain is released under the open source license [LGPL](LICENSE.md) (Lesser General Public License). I.e. regain may be used for free without any temporal limit.

Download

There are two variants of regain: The server search and the desktop search. The desktop search is meant for those, who want to use regain on their workstation or who want to give regain a try. The server search is meant for administrators of a web sercer, who want to integrate a search in their web site or intranet site.

More details about the differences of the two variants can be found in the [comparison of the regain variants](http://regain.murfman.de/en:project_info:variant_comparison).

You can download the old manual here: [Download Anwenderhandbuch_Regain.pdf (in German language)](http://regain.sourceforge.net/download/Anwenderhandbuch_Regain.pdf)


### Seminar thesis about Lucene

During my studies at the FH Karlsruhe I wrote a seminar thesis about lucene. The thesis mentions regain only marginally, but it shows internal details of [Jakarta Lucene](http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene) which is the base of regain.

The thesis is interesting for those who want to learn more about the background of a search engine.
